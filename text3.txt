The easiest way is to use your phone as just a phone. 
There is no shortage of old-fashioned, flip-phone plans that can keep your bill south
 of $50, provided you don't end up receiving a bunch of unexpected text messages. 
 If you want a phone-only phone, you might want to look away from the major carriers, 
 however, which are now focused on lucrative data-hogging customers. 
 If you wander into a local Verizon store, for example, you are likely to find only
 one or two basic phone options.  Smaller carriers and pre-paid services are the right choice here. 
 Those who want cellphones only for emergencies and pay for only the minutes they use can keep their 
 bills down to $20 or even $10 per month. Ditto for those who just don't want to have
 their face buried in a smartphone for hours per day.
