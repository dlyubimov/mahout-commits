Java coffee refers to coffee beans produced in the Indonesian island of Java.
In some countries, including the United States, "Java" can refer to coffee. The 
Indonesian phrase Kopi Jawa refers not only to the origin of the coffee, but is used to 
distinguish a style of strong, black, very sweet coffee.
