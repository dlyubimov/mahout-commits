#!/bin/bash
# 
# Performs the setup procedures for clustering the ASF mail archives
# described in Taming Text.
# 
# Required Command-line Parameters:
#
#   $1 - Path to this script's working directory, you will need about
#        22GB of free space to run this script.
#
#   $2 - Path to where the ASF Public Archive data is, untarred.
#        If you are running Hadoop and the files are in HDFS, then
#        this will need to be an HDFS path.   Default is $1/input
#   $3 - Path to where this script saves the SequenceFile output.
#        If you are running Hadoop and you want the sequence files
#        saved to your HDFS then you need to set this value to an 
#        HDFS path and make sure you set HADOOP_HOME so Mahout can
#        find Hadoop.  Default is $1/sequence-files
#
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#
#   MAHOUT_HOME   
#          Root directory of your Mahout distribution
#
#   HADOOP_HOME
#          Only needed if you want to send output to HDFS
#
# Example:
#   ./prep_asf_mail_archives.sh /mnt/asf-mail-archives /mnt/asf-archives/asf-mail-archives-7-18-2011 /mnt/asf-mail-archives/output
#
#   This will download the TAR files from S3, extract them, and then
#   run the Mahout org.apache.mahout.text.SequenceFilesFromMailArchives job
#   to create Hadoop SequenceFiles in /mnt/asf-mail-archives/output
